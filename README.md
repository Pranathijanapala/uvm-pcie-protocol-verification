# UVM-Based PCIe Protocol Verification

This repository demonstrates a UVM-based verification environment
for a simplified PCIe protocol model.

## Project Scope
- Transaction-level PCIe behavior verification
- UVM testbench architecture (driver, monitor, scoreboard)
- Assertion-based checks for protocol compliance
- Constrained-random stimulus generation

## Key Features
- Verification of PCIe TLP packet formatting
- Validation of flow control and ordering rules
- Coverage-driven verification for normal and corner cases

## Tools & Technologies
- SystemVerilog
- UVM
- QuestaSim / Synopsys VCS (simulation)
- SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA)

## Notes
This project uses simplified RTL and testbench components
created solely for learning and demonstration purposes.
No proprietary or production IP is included.
